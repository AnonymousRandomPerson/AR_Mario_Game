//json parameters for our input:
//each surface polygon information within each surface
//each surface waypoints?? -> can be derived
//each surface jumpability? -> can be derived

//things tested: surface walls to jump over, graps - jumpable and not, non rectangular surfaces, non linear path
//things to test: slant surfaces, multiple paths to choose from (corwded objects) objects to go under, objects on tables?, curcular surfaces
